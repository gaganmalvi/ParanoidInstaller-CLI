### Features:
- ROMs, ZIP installer (works with any recovery that supports ADB sideload)
- Easy recovery installer
- Ability to download files with your specified URLs

### Issues and Caution
- Works only on A-only QCOM devices at the moment that have fastboot and ADB
- Dynamic partitioned A-only devices may work, it's untested and not recommended (if you have specifically tested it, you can let me know at the email at the bottom of the README)
- Specifically tested on my device: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X (mido)

### In The Future
- Will add support for fastboot flashing IMGs for system, vendor, odm and other partitions respectively.
- Will add support for A/B partitioned devices.
- Automatic downloads of ROMs using the codename itself.
